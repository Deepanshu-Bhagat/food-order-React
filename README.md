# food-order-React [YourFood.com](https://your-food.netlify.app/)

version 1.0 .</br>
Ths is a React food order website lets you add items in your cart, delete cart items etc. </br>
You can not order food items right now its is just a prototype. Currently not fetching data from API just using hard-written data. </br> 
But may add new functionalities in future (next version) like fetching data from API, connecting to db <b>stripe payment</b>, <b>firebase google authentication</b> and <b>live location access</b> etc.
